When it comes to masters programs there are a lot of variability and if you are trying to be a therapist you should try to identify what type of therapist you are trying to be. So you might be asking what are the different types of therapist? There are 4 types

- Social Worker
- Mental Health Counselor
- Addiction Counselor
- Family and Marriage Therapist

**Social Workers** are going to be the most broad type of therapist as social workers can be your stereotypical therapist but you also people in non therapeutic ways like helping someone find stable housing. If you are interested in being a social worker most school should just have a masters in social work and I would suggest reading up on the [social workers code of ethics](https://www.socialworkers.org/About/Ethics/Code-of-Ethics/Code-of-Ethics-English). Because Social work is broad there are a lot of different types of jobs you can hold and all of them will pay differently so if you are interested in just having your own private practice that will be different from working for a hospice. Generally though on average according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Social Workers in 2022 made a median salary of [$55,350](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/social-workers.htm). Something to keep in mind is especially if you plan on doing clinical therapy then you need to get a masters in social work as just a bachelors will not be enough.

When it comes to the licensure you can get as a social worker there are 3 you can get but make sure to check on a state level as their will be individual differences. First is the Baccalaureate Social Worker (LBSW) which you can get with just a bachelors then you have Master Social Worker (LMSW) which you get after graduating with a masters and you can do supervised therapy but after you complete all the supervision you can apply and get a Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) license and practice independently 


Mental Health Counselor's are the direct path if you know you want to be a clinical therapist who see's clients, schooling for a MHC is focused on a lot of therapeutic interventions and clinical training compared to social work, if you are interested in being a mental health counselor I suggest you read the [counselor code of ethics](https://www.counseling.org/docs/default-source/default-document-library/ethics/2014-aca-code-of-ethics.pdf?sfvrsn=55ab73d0_1).
