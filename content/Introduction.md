When I was in my Sophomore year of high school I had decided that I was going to be a therapist and it was a long winding road but as I continued to learn more and more about the mental health space, the professions and degrees that are along side it I was lost too many times to count and wanted to formalize all of my thoughts into a written text. So I write this to help other people who don't know where to 

The best place to start if you are thinking of becoming a therapist is to start at the end, work backwards and then see who are the people that are allowed to practice therapy.

If you want to be a therapist you have to at least have a masters through there are multiple degrees at the doctoral level to be a therapist, The degrees/programs that train therapist and I will be covering can be categorized into three main degree paths:

Medical School
	- Psychiatry, either becoming a Doctor of Medicine (MD) or a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO)

Doctorate Programs
	- Clinical Psychologist (Ph.D)
	- Clinical Psychologist (Psy.D)
	- Counseling Psychologist (Ph.D)

Masters Programs
	- Counseling or Clinical Mental Health Counselor (CMH)
	- Social Work (SWM)
	- Addiction Counseling (AC)
	- Marriage and Family Therapist (MFT)

While I will go into more depth in future pages to get a general outline between the differences

**Medical School**: Medical School is going to be focused on prescribing psychiatric medication (SSRI's, Anti Psychotics, etc), Being medical doctors psychiatrist by far make the most money out of any type of practitioner I will talk about with a median annual wage of [$220,430](https://www.bls.gov/oes/2019/may/oes291223.htm), the average psychiatrist spends 4 years in a undergraduate course, 4 years in medical school, and 4 years in residency earning anywhere in the [50-70k](https://psychiatry.arizona.edu/academic-programs/ua-psychiatry-residency/salary-benefits) range while in residency each year earning more money. If you are interested read more on my [[Medical School Overview]] page.

**Doctorate Programs**: Doctorate Programs are going to be generally focused on producing scientific research while also providing clinical training secondary although there are some exceptions for example the Clinical Psychology (Psy.D) path, people who go down the doctorate path will spend 4 years in a undergraduate program, 2-3 years post-bachelor working in a research laboratory to then go into a doctorate program that can last 4 years (Psy.D) or 6 years with one of those years being for a clinical internship (Ph.D). While in schooling students pursuing a Ph.D can have reduced tuition rates by working for their university and funded programs will provide students with a stipend that ranges anywhere from [15-30k ](https://yocket.com/blog/phd-stipend-salary-jobs-in-usa)depending on location. After graduating Clinical & Counseling Psychologist earn a median annual wage of [80,000](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/09/psychologists-earn). If this path sounds interesting read my [[Doctorate Program Overview]] page.

**Masters Programs**: Masters Programs are the shortest, lowest paying but most common path for anyone interested in being a therapist, masters programs also have the most diversity in terms of degree options with some people picking a marriage and family program while others pick an addictions program. Someone going into a masters program will on average spend 4 years in a undergraduate program and then 2 years in a masters program graduating with an associate license in the degree they choose. On average people who are counselors/therapist will earn a median annual wage of [$49,710](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/community-and-social-service/substance-abuse-behavioral-disorder-and-mental-health-counselors.htm).

If all of these degrees do relatively the same job then you might be asking why the huge pay discrepancy? For my theory check out this page [[What Are The Pay Differential Factors]]
